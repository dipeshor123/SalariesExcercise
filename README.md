Exploration Ideas
To help get you started, here are some data exploration ideas:
  How have salaries changed over time between different groups of people?
  How are base pay, overtime pay, and benefits allocated between different groups?
  Is there any evidence of pay discrimination based on gender in this dataset?
  How is budget allocated based on different groups and responsibilities?
